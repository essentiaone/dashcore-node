Essentia Node
============

A Ess full node for building applications and services with Node.js. A node is extensible and can be configured to run additional services. At the minimum a node has an interface to [ESSX Core (essd)](https://github.com/essentiaone/essx) for more advanced address queries. Additional services can be enabled to make a node more useful such as exposing new APIs, running a block explorer and wallet service.

## Usages

```bash
git clone https://github.com/essentiaone/essx-node
cd essx-node
npm install
```
